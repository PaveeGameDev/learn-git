        //Question 3 - Good job on completing your second question, now output the same thing 10 thousand times.





        //Question 4 - I hope you weren't writing it down 10 thousand times and that you found a better solution, now output the same thing only if the name exactly matches yours, otherwise output NO (if I change the variable to Patrik, it will output NO).
